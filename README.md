Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools and it's use in testing development deployment of software products amongst other varing functions.(according to plp teaching)

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? software engineering is the application of design process to develop software.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.  Provide a brief description of each phase. :SDLC are in the following stages - 1.Requirements:This is the gathering of info which the user needs and the systems requirements.
2. Design: This is a high level of detailed design which also carries the user interface and is being added to the architecture of the software designs. 3. Implementation: Codes is necessary as it will be used in the building of the design specifications,so it needs to be written down. 4. Testing:Test are being conducted to ensure it meets the standards and functional requirements of a quality software. 5. Deployment: This stage involves releasing the software to users inorder to know how it works. 6. Maintenance: Always ensure to note that maintenance is key as this phase will help provide support, updates and enhancement where necessary to the software that has been deployed.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Agile helps to ensure that improvement in communication between the development team and the product owner is adequately reached, also it ensures that development teams complete projects on time and within budget. So in order words they come together as a team to collaborate and respond to changes. Waterfall is just like the name implies its a project that focuses on a linear progression from the beginning to the end of the project. it is often used as its rely on careful planning and detailed documentation and consecutive execution. (according to 

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? : Agile is flexible and iterative and its emphasises on continuous feedback and adaptation. while Waterfall is typically focusing on the information technology and its characterized by a structured sequential approach. in scenario agile will be better suited for projects where stakeholders are closely involved every step of the way, as it has more responsive customer feedbacks, high job satisfaction and faster fixes. while Waterfall is more preferred in a company where raising new funding to monitor payout structures and bringing in additional investment and other types of liquidity events.
Requirements Engineering: This is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the engineering design processes. it helps to achieve the primary objective of making sure that the delivered system meets the customer's needs.(according to fullscale.io)

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.: Requirement engineering is the process of developing and verifying the system requirements and by following good requirements engineering practices helps achieve the primary objective of making sure that the delivered system meets customers needs. Importance in software development lifecycle are: it shapes out digital world, it drives technology advancement, it enables businesses to thrive, it helps to apply engineering principles and knowledge of programing language to build software solutions for end users, it helps to communicate, adapts and grow within the software community. (according to geeksforgeeks.org)
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? Modularity in design is a design principle that subdivides a system into smaller parts called module which can be independently created, modified, replaced , or exchange with other modules or between different systems. It helps to improve scalability by understanding the needs of the users whereby the first steps to design a scalable and efficient system is to modularize it into smaller, independent and loosely coupled components. it helps in adding processing capacity in order to remain reliable under high load. while Maintainability is essentially about making life better for the engineering and Operation teams who need to work with the system. So basically the maintainability and scalability of software systems helps to make flexibility possible and enable business adapt and expand their software systems quickly to meet changing demands leading to improved scalability while reducing operational and maintenance costs.

Testing in Software Engineering: This is the process of checking the quality functionality and performance of a software product before launching. To do this testers must interact with the software manually or executive test scripts to find bugs and errors, ensuring that the software works as expected. (according to institutedata.com)

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? Unit testing: This are low level test and close to the source of an application. Integration testing: This type of test verifies that different modules or services used by your application work well together. System testing: This is the type of trst that evaluates how a system performs under a particular work load. It helps to measure speed, scalability, responsiveness amongst others of an application. Acceptance testing: This is a formal test that verifies if a system satisfies business requirements. Testing is crucial because it helps in reducing project risks, providing confidence in the software quality, meeting compliance needs, ensuring satisfied users, and enabling continuous improvement and also to reduce cost. 
Version Control Systems: Version control system are source control system which is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software codes. These are tools that helps software teams to manage changes to source code over time. (according to encyclopedia.com)

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.: They are important because its needed to track and manage changes to software code. its also a crucial feature in documents management system because it helps ensure that the most up to date and accurate documents are being used and it improves collaborations, efficiency, quality and security. Examples: Github, Bitbucket, Fossil SCM etc their feathers - they track responsibility, they combine versions that diverged from a common previous version, they work in parallel, they separate branches for each developer.
Software Project Management: This is the process of planning and leading software projects. its a subdiscipline of projects management in which software project are planned, implemented,monitored and controlled. (according to techtarget.com)

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?: The role of a software manager is to manage project developers, engineers, IT so they practically carry out the planning of execution to the delivery stage, they oversee the software development team, they delegate work efficiently, they monitor progress and track roadblocks, they manage the deployment deliverables. Some key challenges faced are: poor communication, lack of accountability, unclear goals, skill gaps, insufficient risk analysis, stakeholders disengagement amongst many others.
Software Maintenance: software maintenance is the process of modifying, changing and updating a software system or module to resolve errors, improve performance or adapt to a changing environment. It helps to upgrade on types of process which modifies and update software to stay up with clients needs.(according to radixweb.com)

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? Software maintenance is the modification of a software product after delivery.   Type of maintenance activities are: Corrective maintenance: is necessary when something goes wrong in a piece of software including faults and errors,so its ise to correct any errors. Preventive maintenance: Is a future base so the software can keep working as desired for as long as possible without issues.  Perfective maintenance: Is an aim in adjusting software by adding new features as necessary and removing features that are irrelevant or not effective in the given software. Adaptive maintenance: Has to do with changing technology as well as policies and rules regarding your software. (according to thales group)

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering: These are concern issues that arises during the design of technology products, processes, systems and services which includes safety, sustainability,user autonomy and privacy. (according to encyclopedia.com)

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? : some ethical issues are as follows: Autonomy, beneficence, justice, and non-maleficence. (according to ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) Software engineers should ensure to promote fairness and inclusivity inorder to encourage other software engineers to consider the potential biases in algorithm and address.
